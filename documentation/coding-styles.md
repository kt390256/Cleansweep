#Coding Styles agreed upon

##Code Commenting
All code changes should use the following comments in HTML or JS comment blocks:
  @author  CSC 648 Team 11
  @version 1.0.0 mm/dd/2018
Update any comment blocks with today's date if any changes are made to that code.
Currently this is inserted at the top of each file. In situations where a particular file has many functions, it is recommended to insert additional comment blocks where appropriate to illustrate the evolution of the file.

##Naming of functions and variables
Name all variables and functions in a way that clarifies its purpose and minimize documentation requirements. Use UML Diagrams as appropriate to assist with naming conventions.

##Git Commit Commenting
All Git Commits should have one or two sentences that succinctly and completely summarize what changes were made to the codebase in that commit.
Do NOT put vague messages such as "updated code" or "added documentation"
Examples of good commit messages:
"Added Coding Style MD to documentation folder"
"Integrated Google Maps in search results"
