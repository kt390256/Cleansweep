##Key Risks

#Skills
Team is largely unfamiliar with Handlebars.
  Steps Planned: Planning better documentation for files, and Rodolfo is training Jason on the back-end to better understand it. Dylan has also been familiarizing himself more and can help Avi in turn on the Front End.
Frank is unfamiliar with computers in general and team is unable to get the local server infrastructure working on his computer.
  Steps Planned: Frank is mostly focusing on documentation and QA.

#Scheduling
Brady has a very tight schedule with work, personal issues, and other classes, and is concerned about having sufficient time to continue guiding team progress towards Milestone deliverables safely.
  Steps Planned: Team has implemented a project management app called Asana to help manage tasks and assignments, with respective due dates, to better organize.
In general, we are somewhat concerned about having sufficient time for addressing QA.
  Steps Planned: Frank has been assigned overall responsibility for now to run QA tests on live site every few days and put in feedback accordingly. In addition, we will ensure prioritization is on P1 functionality during QA efforts.

#Technical
Back-end has concerns over how to implement database setup correctly and cleanly.
  Steps Planned: Our vertical prototype will allow us to analyze our implementation and adjust as necessary.
Front-end has concerns over how to properly secure code.
  Steps Planned: Will restrict access to database behind DB credentials, while keeping good validation of input from website fields.
